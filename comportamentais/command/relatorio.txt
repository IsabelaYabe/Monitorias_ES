ONCE ON A FARM LONG AGO, a Mama Duck sat on her nest.  “How long must I wait for my babies to hatch? I have to sit here all by myself!”  But what could she do? A Mama duck must keep her eggs warm till they hatch.  

At last, the eggs began to crack.  One yellow duckling stepped out of its shell, then another.  Each little chick shook its wings. “Quack, quack!”

“Look at you!” cried Mama Duck with joy.  “You’re all so cute!”
